      <p>Our nominated property management  team consists of <span class="cbre-has-text-brand-two">Name</span>, our City Asset Services Director coupled with  <span class="cbre-has-text-brand-two">Name</span>, Property Manager. A key point  of difference for CBRE’s property  management approach is our ‘buddy’ system consisting of a junior and a senior  property manager as a partnership. Our  experience and track record has proven  this approach to be extremely effective in delivering a high level of service  whilst keeping the management fees to  a competitive level. <span class="cbre-has-text-brand-two">Name</span> will assume  ultimate responsibility for the asset, lead  the initial property transition to ensure  the property is set up and running in  line with CBRE’s global standards, lead  the tenant management, and support  Company in the overall delivery of the asset strategy. <span class="cbre-has-text-brand-two">Name</span> will oversee the lease  administration tasks and minor tenant  requests for the asset.</p>
