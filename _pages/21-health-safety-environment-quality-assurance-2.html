      <p>As part of the CBRE approach to risk management, CBRE will facilitate the external property risk audit program. Frequency of external audits will be at least biennial though in some circumstances, based on the risk of the asset, the asset class or asset history this may be conducted annually. Such audits would be undertaken by a competent and independent health and safety consultant (CBRE recommends Prensa or GreenCap) and would seek to achieve the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To identify the physical hazards at the property, assess the risks and make recommendations to control such risk.</li>
        <li>Confirm that an appropriate health and safety management system (either CBRE’s or in some cases the tenants) is being implemented at the property CBRE will supplement these independent annual/biennial audits, with provision of ongoing monitoring, tracking of completion of corrective action, analysis and identification of trends, management of incidents and recommendation of corrective action to be applied across portfolio and sample assessment of continued compliance with HS&amp;E management systems via CBRE internal assessments.</li>
