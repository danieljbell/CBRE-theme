      <p>CBRE recognises that this commitment is a critical component of our overall business strategy. Our goals in workplace safety and environmental management are achieved  through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Implementing a HSE management system, the cornerstone of which is the CBRE HSE policy</li>
        <li>Integrating HSE management in all relevant business processes and decisions.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="cbre-pad-y">HSEQ Management System (Including Any ISO9001 Compliant Management System)</h2>
      <p>The CBRE HSE management system has been created specifically to meet the needs of the Pacific region. The system has been developed in accordance with Australian Standards and is comprised of risk management procedures applicable to both the organization as a whole and specific business lines.</p>
      <p>CBRE effectively communicates and promotes the policies and procedures comprising the HSE management system via a dedicated CBRE HSE website and “the Hub”, designed to create uniformity across the business and act as the main pillar in the storage of all documents associated with managing property.</p>
