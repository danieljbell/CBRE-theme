      <p>In the interest of providing a high-level  of building management presence and keeping management expense to a minimum, we are nominating <span class="cbre-has-text-brand-two">Name</span> as the Facility Manager to oversee the operational management of the building. <span class="cbre-has-text-brand-two">Name</span> currently oversees <span class="cbre-has-text-brand-two">Building Name</span> on a 00% allocation of time and we propose that the balance of his time be spent at <span class="cbre-has-text-brand-two">Building Name</span>. There are considerable efficiencies with having a facility manager’s sites located in immediate proximity and this arrangement will have the effect of close to full-time, on-site presence, should a tenant need urgent assistance.</p>

    <div class="unit half">
      <p>We are open to discussing the final allocation of facility management presence at <span class="cbre-has-text-brand-two">Building Name</span> to suit the requirements of <span class="cbre-has-text-brand-two">Client Name</span>, including scaling back the allocation after 6 or 12 months once the property has been transitioned and is operating on a ‘business as usual’ basis.</p>
      <p>Our building management team will implement our PULSE Response Centre— our 24/7 tenant helpdesk and portal— which is fully integrated with our property management platform.</p>
