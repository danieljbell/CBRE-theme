      <p>Designed to manage and reduce risk, our inspection app is used by our facility managers to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Conduct audits and routine inspections.</li>
        <li>Upload imagery and commentary on-the-go while on-site to cross-reference at any time.</li>
        <li>Predefine audit lists per property to capture unique characteristics of and service performance at each site.</li>
        <li>Integrate with PULSE to assign actions to the relevant personnel.</li>
        <li>Quickly and efficiently collate content; providing you with visual representation of your asset.</li>
        <li>Save time allowing them to spend more time focusing on delivering an enhanced tenant experience and less time on the administration.</li>
      </ul>
