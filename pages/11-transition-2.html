      <h2>Transition Toolkit</h2>
      <p>The resources available to the CBRE transition team are extensive and comprehensive. Our online library incorporates over 25 documents related to the transition of a property, including a Property Transition Checklist, which is specific to all operations of a building. This checklist will be refined to specifically meet your transition needs. Other items included for the use of the team during the transition include: tenant letters, vendor letters, forms required for ordering site-specific items, and, an inclusive request for documents from the owner (or prior manager). All of these resources promote a seamless transition process and enable an incredibly compressed timeline if required.</p>
